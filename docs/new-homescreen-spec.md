# Home Screen MyDiary Style Transformation

## Current State Analysis
Your `DashboardHomeScreen.tsx` currently has:
- ✅ Stats header with streak, total entries, mood summary
- ✅ Scrollable entry feed with cards
- ✅ Entry preview cards showing date + content preview
- ✅ Proper loading states and empty states

## Target State (MyDiary Style)
Transform to match MyDiary's aesthetic while keeping functionality:
- **Narrower dashboard stats** (more compact)
- **Dark purple theme** throughout
- **Cleaner entry cards** with MyDiary's minimal style
- **Simplified typography** and spacing
- **Purple accent colors** instead of blue

## Specific Changes Required

### 1. Theme Updates
**Colors to Change:**
- Primary blue (`#2563eb`) → Purple (`#7C3AED`)
- Background white → Dark gradient (`#1e1b4b` to `#312e81`)
- Card backgrounds → Semi-transparent dark (`rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`)
- Text colors → Light gray/white

### 2. Dashboard Header (Make Narrower)
**Current**: Large stats cards taking significant vertical space
**Target**: Compact horizontal row

**Modifications needed:**
- Reduce `statsContainer` padding from current to `paddingVertical: 16`
- Make stat cards smaller and more horizontal
- Reduce font sizes for stat numbers
- Tighter spacing between stat items
- Add subtle purple gradient background

### 3. Entry Cards Styling
**Current**: White cards with shadows and mood/insight sections
**Target**: Dark cards with minimal content

**Changes:**
- Background: `backgroundColor: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.1)'`
- Remove AI insight preview sections
- Simplify to: Date + Title + Content preview only
- Add subtle purple border on left edge
- Reduce card padding
- Make date text smaller and purple-tinted

### 4. Typography Updates
**Headers**: Reduce weight, lighter colors
**Body text**: Switch to light gray (`#e2e8f0`)
**Dates**: Purple accent color (`#a855f7`)
**Meta text**: Subtle gray (`#94a3b8`)

### 5. Spacing & Layout
**Overall**: Tighter spacing to match MyDiary's compact feel
- Reduce gaps between cards from `16` to `12`
- Smaller section paddings
- More content visible on screen

## Key Files to Modify
