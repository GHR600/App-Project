## Project Overview

This is a minimal Python project containing only an empty `start.py` file. The project appears to be in its initial state with no dependencies, build configuration, or established architecture.

## Development Commands

Since this is a basic Python project with no package management or build system configured:

- **Run the main script**: `python start.py`
- **Check Python version**: `python --version`

- Chronological entry feed (newest first)
- AI-generated insights after each entry save

## Notes for Development

- No package manager (pip requirements, poetry, etc.) is currently configured
